## Homework Assignment #6: Advanced Loops

"""
Details:
 
Create a function that takes in two parameters: 
rows, and columns, both of which are integers. 
The function should then proceed to draw a playing 
board (as in the examples from the lectures) 
the same number of rows and columns as specified. 
After drawing the board, your function should return True.

    for row in range(5): #0,1,2,3,4
        if row%2 == 0:#0,2,4
            for column in range(1,6):#1,2,3,4,5
                if column%2 == 1:
                    if column != 5:

Extra Credit:

Try to determine the maximum width and height that your 
terminal and screen can comfortably fit without 
wrapping. If someone passes a value greater than 
either maximum, your function should return False.
